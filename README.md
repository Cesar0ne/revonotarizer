# revonotarizer
Notarevorizer automates document notarization on the Revo blockchain using Python. It monitors a folder for new files, waits until they are stable, computes their SHAâ€‘256 hash, and notarizes them via Revo CLI. It generates PDF receipts and logs events with rotation, plus notarizes random cowsay phrases.
